# CS50
## SPELLER

Implemented a dictionary with C using the Trie data structure.

**The code I have written myself are in dictionary.c and dictionary.h.**

Usage: ./speller [ dictionary ] text

Problem Set link: http://docs.cs50.net/problems/speller/speller.html

Speller was definetly the most fun and challenging problem set of CS50. The 4 functions implemented by me are **load**, **check**, **size** and **unload** located in speller/dictionary.c.
